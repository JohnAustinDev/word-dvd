= Text Input Files =

=== OSIS ===
An osis.xml file can be used as the input file. It will be converted to HTML before processing.

=== HTML ===
You can use HTML files directly with Word-DVD. All HTML input files should be put in your input directory under an `HTML` subdirectory. These HTML files follow some special rules. The names of the HTML files are also important (see below).

Multiple books can be included on one DVD, and their HTML files are named as follows:

|| `<book-name>.html` || the book itself ||
|| `<book-name>.intr.html` || the book's introduction (optional) ||
|| `<book-name>.fn.html` || the book's footnotes (optional) ||

The HTML markup for the above files must follow some special rules which are necessary for proper rendering of pages to DVD:
 * The `<head>...</head>` and `<body>` tags should all be included on line 1 of the file.
 * All other tags within any single line of the HTML file must be closed. So you can't start a `<div>` on one line and end the `</div>` on a later line. Both open and close tags are always on the same line. The last line is the only exception.
 * Only one level of nesting is allowed. You can have a `<div>` containing a stylised `<span>`, but the span cannot itself contain its own child tags.
 * Page breaks which are added during the rendering process only occur at spaces (at ASCII 32). This means that for proper page breaks to be placed in all cases, there must be a space before and/or after each HTML tag.
 * Manual pagebreaks can be added with "`<milestone type="x-pagebreak"/>`" in OSIS files or with "`<span class="pagebreak"></span> `" in HTML files. The space after the HTML end tag is required. Appending "`-both`" to the above type/class attribute will break both left and right pages together.
