Error messages, warnings and other information are reported during run time.

During the initial image rendering phase, a live stream of this information is available in Firefox's Javascript error Console.

During the DVD building phase, a console window will open showing the progress of the build scripts.

There are two log files which save all this information, and both are located under the Word-DVD OUTPUTS directory:
 * logfile.txt
 * err.txt (holds error messages from the DVD building phase)

The logfile.txt file should be checked after each run. If there are errors, these need to be fixed. Warnings are okay. If rendering for DVD, check for valid new DVD files in OUTPUTS/dvd/VIDEO_TS after a successful run.
