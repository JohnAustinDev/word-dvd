Error messages, warnings and other information are reported during run time.

During the initial image rendering phase, a live stream of this information is available in the javascript Error Console. Open the console in Firefox by clicking "Tools"->"Error Console" and click the "All" button at the top to view all types of information.

Important: you must have the following Firefox user preference set to be able to see all the information in the javascript console: in the Firefox address bar type "about:config", then type "javascript" into the "filter" text-box and hit return. If  javascript.options.showInConsole is not listed with a value of "true", then right click on it and select "toggle". This will enable showing information in your javascript console. NOTE: In Firefox 4, the javascript console is disabled by default and so the devtools.errorconsole.enabled preference must be set to "true".

During the DVD building phase, a console window will open showing the progress of the build scripts.

There are two log files which save all this information, and both are located in the Word-DVD output directory:
 * logfile.txt
 * err.txt (holds error messages from the DVD building phase)

The logfile.txt file should be checked after each run. If there are errors, these need to be fixed. Warnings are usually okay.
