== Word-DVD Installation: ==
(Tested on Ubuntu 10.04 and 11.04)

=== These packages need to be installed: ===
  * ffmpeg (compiled with libmp3lame)
  * dvdauthor

=== Word-DVD also uses these and other standard packages ===
  * firefox
  * perl
  * ImageMagick
  * genisoimage (1.1.9 and eariler versions result in ISOs which are incompatible with Windows XP)
  * growisofs

=== Word-DVD utilities and debugging features need these packages installed ===
  * ecasound
  * libaudio-ecasound-perl
  * dvbsnoop
  * eyeD3


=== Steps ===
1) Install the modified mjpegtools package using the [http://word-dvd.googlecode.com/files/modified-mjpegtools-i386.deb debian package] or [http://word-dvd.googlecode.com/files/modified-mjpegtools-1.9.0.tar.gz from source]. This mjpegtools package contains a modified `"mplex"` multiplexer utility which is capable of creating highly compressed slide shows (10's of hours on a single DVD rather than just 1 or 2).

If you get an "illegal instruction" error when running jpeg2yuv, mplex, or mpeg2enc, then your CPU is incompatible with the provided binary and you'll have to compile from source (provided above) on your machine.

2) Install the `"Word-DVD-xx.xpi"` Firefox extension included with this distribution. Then, firefox's "Tools" menu will show "Word-DVD...". Click this to start the program.

3) Click the browse button for the input directory and choose the directory where your input files are located (to use the example inputs, unzip the folder somewhere and choose it). If you have audio, uncheck the "none" checkbox and browse for your audio directory (to use the example audio, choose the `"audio"` directory within the example directory). Create a directory called `"OUTPUTS"` somewhere, then click the browse button and choose this as your output directory.

4) Click Go! You should see a prompt when it's finished. If not, see the [http://code.google.com/p/word-dvd/wiki/Debugging debugging wiki] page for hints.

=== Testing and Burning to DVD ===
The final DVD files will be located in `OUTPUTS/dvd`. To burn these to DVD you need to use the proper file system, so run:
{{{
sudo xcreateiso.sh
}}}
Which is located in `OUTPUTS/script`. Then you should see the `OUTPUTS/dvd.iso` file which is ready for burning to DVD. By running `xcreateiso.sh` with `sudo`, the script will also be able to mount the iso as a dvd under `/media/dvd`.

To burn and verify a DVD, run:
{{{
./xburnverify.sh
}}}
