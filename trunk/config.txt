# OSIS TO HTML CONVERSION SETTINGS:
#----------------------------------
# MajorQuoteS (start) and MajorQuoteE (end) are perl regular

# DVD AUTOMATED MENU GENERATOR SETTINGS:

# TOC suffix can also be leftlast or rightlast to force a page break after such a value.
# Suffixes ending with "T" are menu targets which override the default target.
# Note: All UI strings may include special codes which will be replaced by values at runtime:
#   %0$S = becomes current book
#   %1$S = becomes current chapter
#   %2$S = becomes current verse
#   %3$S = becomes current last-verse
