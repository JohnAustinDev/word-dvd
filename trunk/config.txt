# DVD AUTOMATED MENU GENERATOR SETTINGS:
#---------------------------------------
# The main DVD menu is designated TOC1 and can be multiple pages: TOC[page]
# Chaper submenu's are designated by CHP.
# Parameters below are comprised of a menu designation prefix followed by a suffix.
# Prefix is TOC[page] for main-menu pages (if page is left out, value applies to all TOC pages)
# Prefix is CHP for chapter-menu pages (in which case special value %BOOK% will be replaced by a chapter number)
# Suffix can be topleft, topright, bottomleft, bottomright, or button[n].
# TOC[page] suffix can also be leftlast or rightlast: A page break is forced after such a value.
# Suffix button[n] corresponds to the nth button on the menu, and this allows over-riding of any default button name.
# Suffixes beginning with "bottom" or "button" and ending with "T" are menu targets which override the default target.
# Values for terms enging in "T" must be found in the menus.txt file.
