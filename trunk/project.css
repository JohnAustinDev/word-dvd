/* ADDING MENU AND TEXT IMAGES */
/*******************************/

/* An image can be placed on any menu or text page by adding it to 
the appropriate html file, or else by using css as follows:*/
/*
body[pagename="toc-m1"]:before {
  content:url(./images/myimage.png);
}

You can also make the text writer skip the left and/or right
page of any screen by adding something like this:

body[pagename="book1-1-1"] #writing-left {
  display:none;
}

*/

/* IMPORTANT:
The total number of colors which can be used in any -HIGH or -SEL 
images is very limited. If too many colors are used, errors will result 
when the DVD menus are created. */
