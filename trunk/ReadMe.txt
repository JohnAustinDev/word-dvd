DESCRIPTION OF FILES AND FOLDERS

config.txt
----------
The main configuration file for a Word-DVD project. Update this file with
book names, user interface phrases, menu layout scheme, and more. Details
can be found within the file itself.


pageTiming.txt
--------------
Contains all transition timing information. This file is only needed
if audio is included in the project. General settings to aid in the
calculation of page transitions are required. More specific (per book
or chapter) settings can also be used to further improve calculation
accuracy. Exact transition timings, as well as text-locative timing
information can also be entered here. A tool called "xtransitions.sh"
can be used to generate these entries. More details can be found within
pageTiming.txt itself. After modifying pageTiming.txt, xword-dvd.sh (for
DVD) or xvideo-sh (for video files) can be rerun to apply the transitions.


multiChapterTiming.txt
----------------------
Preferably each audio file contains a single chapter. But in some cases a
single audio file contains multiple chapters or even an entire book. The
multiChapterTiming.txt file is only needed in such cases. After the first
run, a multiChapterTiming.txt will be created in ./OUTPUTS/audio/ which
contains calculated chapter boundaries. This file should be copied to ./
and then actual chapter boundary timings should be manually entered into
the file.


osis.xml
--------
Optional: Word-DVD will optionally convert an OSIS file into HTML. It
should be named osis.xml. There are certain constraints placed on the
OSIS markup. See the osis2html.pl script.


html directory
--------------
Contains the text to be rendered to DVD. These files are either generated
by hand or created by Word-DVD's OSIS to HTML converter. All html files
can use pre-defined CSS classes and must conform to the following rules:

- The first and last lines of each html file are dropped by the rendering
engine, so the entire html header, and other non-renderable code, should
be on line 1, or else the last line.

- Text, introductions, and footnotes are each contained in separate
files, so each book can have up to three html files associated with it
(named <book>.html, <book>.intr.html, and <book>.fn.html respectively).

- The following tags/classes should be used where applicable:
Paragraph-start          = <br><span class="paragraph-start"></span>
Verse-start              = <sup>verse-number</sup>
Chapter-start            = <span name="chapter.n"></span>
Footnote-symbol          = <span class="fnsymbol" id="note.n"></span>
Pagebreak                = <span class="pagebreak"></span>
Footnote-start           = <div class="footnote">footnote-text</div>
Footnote-verse-reference =
           <span class="verseref" id="note.n">verse-reference</span>

- These title classes: title-1 and title-2, are available for titles
and should be applied to a <div> containing a title.

- The following classes (referred to as "splitable") are also available
and should be appled to a <div> containing the corresponding material:
majorquote, x-list-1, x-list-2, x-enumlist-1, x-enumlist-2, x-enumlist-3

- All tags within each line of an html file must be closed. No tag can
be opened on one line of the file and closed on another.

- <sup> tags may only be used for verse-start, and nowhere else.

- "Splitable" tags (see above) must not occur within any other tags. These
tags are special in that they can be properly split across rendered
pages. For instance, a majorquote can begin on one rendered page and
end many pages later, and each page will render that style correctly.

- "Splitable" tags may contain another single level of other
(non-splitable) tags. But non-splitable tags cannot be split across page
boundaries. For instance, a long bold section of text cannot be properly
rendered across page boundaries.

- Non-splitable tags should not contain any other tags.


audio directory
---------------
Audio files for the project can be put in the audio directory. Audio
is optional and can be disabled by checking the "no-audio" checkbox
on the word-dvd control window. They are ideally one chapter per file,
but can contain more than one chapter (even a whole book).

-Audio files must be AC3 encoded at 48000Hz sample rate.

-Not all chapters need to have an audio file.

-Audio can be mono or stereo.

-Audio files need the following naming convention:
<AudioPrefix>-<BookName>-<ChapterNumber>.ac3

-or in the case of multiple chapters in one audio file:
<AudioPrefix>-<BookName>-<ChapterNumber>-<ChapterNumber>.ac3

-<AudioPrefix> and <BookName> must appear in the appropriate place in
the config.txt.


artwork directory
-----------------
Images like artwork, tables, drawings, or photos can be rendered onto
the DVD. Images are optional. Currently, images are allowed on the
left side of menu pages and on the left side of the first page of each
chapter. To apply an image, simply place a .png file in this directory
with the following naming convention:

toc-m1.png = first menu page of the DVD's root menu.
<book>-m2.png = second page of <book>'s chapter-menu.
<book>-3.png = the beginning of <book>'s third chapter.


menus directory
---------------
Book and chapter menus are created automatically by Word-DVD, but custom
menus can also be added if desired. Each menu page can have up to four
images associated with it (1 image for the menu, and up to 3 images for
the button modes: normal, hilighted, and selected). All these images and
their inter-relations need to be described in the menus.txt file. The
menus.txt file defines each menu's buttons (their x-y location in their
image file, and the images associated with each button state), as well
as the target of each button.

These menus can reference one another and can also be referenced in the
config.txt file. The help-m1 menu is a special case which is referenced
automatically by each text page in the DVD (currently this menu is 
required, not optional like the others).


defaults directory
------------------
This directory holds the CSS, background images, button images, and 
more, needed to render the DVD. Anything in this directory can be 
changed as desired. For instance, new background images, button images, 
and CSS styling could be applied. Then during the next rendering 
session these modified files will be used.



REVISION HISTORY

-----
- Added this ReadMe.
- Added default config.txt and other input files necessary to create a 
minimal working DVD when an empty project directory is selected.
