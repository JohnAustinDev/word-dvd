# FOR AUDIO FILES WITH MULTIPLE CHAPTERS IN A SINGLE FILE:
#---------------------------------------------------------
# If an audio file contains more than one chapter in it, then 
# measured start points for each chapter within the audio file 
# should be provided. After running word-dvd once, start by copying 
# the "multiChapterTiming.txt" file from the OUTPUTS/audio directory 
# over the file you're now reading. The file will list the calculated 
# chapter boundaries within the audio file. You must then add the 
# actual timing of the chapter boundaries after the calculated value 
# as the following examples show:
#
# Matt-1 = 00:00:00.00
# Matt-2 = 00:02:57.96 3:21.254
# Matt-3 = 00:06:19.60 6:41.52
