# TRANSITION CALCULATION SETTINGS:
#---------------------------------
# Transitions are calculated automatically. The accuracy of these 
# transitions depends on many factors, such as the accuracy of the 
# settings below, and the amout of dramatization in the reading 
# (highly dramatized readings with multiple speakers reading at 
# different speeds, pauses for sound effects, etc. are impossible to 
# calculate accurately. On the other hand if it is a strict reading 
# by a single speaker then transitions can often be calculated with 
# amazing accuracy.

# The following general settings can be made more specific 
# by suffixing _OT, _NT, _<book>, or _<book>_<chapter>
# General timings are overwritten by actual timings
# if they are available.

# If true, a timing pause is added for auto generated chapter titles.
CountChapterNumbersAsTitle = false 

# If titles are read aloud, set this to true.
TitlesAreRead = true  

TitleAudioGap     = 2   # typical dead time around all titles
BookStartGap      = 4   # typical dead time at the start of a new book
BookEndGap        = 1   # typical dead time at the end of a book
ChapterStartGap   = 1   # typical dead time at the start of each chapter
ChapterEndGap     = 1   # typical dead time at the end of each chapter

# NOTE: The above parameters are additive. So the calculated dead 
# time at the beginning of the first chapter of a book is 
#   BookStartGap + ChapterStartGap
# And assuming TitlesAreRead=true, the calulated time for a title is 
#   TitleAudioGap + (calculated-title-read-time)


# PRECISE TRANSITION SETTINGS:
------------------------------
# Use the xtransition.sh tool to record exact page transitions into 
# this file. Run it with no arguments to see usage. This tool records 
# both absolute page transition timings, as well as text-locative 
# timings. Absolute page transition timings will be exact until the 
# pages are re-rendered with the addition of artwork or a change in 
# font-size etc. After this, these exact transitions MUST BE DELETED 
# (or else all transitions will be very wrong!) However, NEVER DELETE 
# THE TEXT-LOCATIVE TIMINGS because they will continue to provide 
# excellent transition accuracy even if the layout is changed 
# dramatically.
